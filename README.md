# userconcept-forms

Forms inline validation in neumorphism style (Constraint Validation API, JavaScript).

## About project

This experimental project is an attempt to implement form validation UI/UX best practices by use of built-in form validation, Constraint Validation API and WAI-ARIA. If user just focus or change focus on fields - messages are not shown. Inline validation (real time) start to show help messages, when user input something not valid to fields. When field becomes valid - message is hide. If user try to submit form - all fields are checked for validity and messages are shown. Form can also contain interdependent fields. User needs to input valid value to Phone or/and E-mail field for form success validation state.

UI style of forms is neumorphism for aesthetic look.
